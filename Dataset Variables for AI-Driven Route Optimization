Dataset Variables for AI-Driven Route Optimization
Origin: The starting location ID of a delivery or transportation route.

Destination: The ending location ID, indicating where the goods or services are to be delivered.

Traffic_Delay: The delay in time (in minutes or hours) due to traffic conditions between the origin and destination.

Distance: The total distance (in kilometers or miles) between the origin and destination.

Vehicle_ID: A unique identifier for the vehicle assigned to a specific delivery route.

Vehicle_1_Capacity to Vehicle_5_Capacity: The carrying capacity (in units of weight or volume) of different vehicles in the fleet, allowing for flexibility in selecting the optimal vehicle for deliveries.

Load: The weight or volume of the goods being transported in a particular delivery.

Fuel_Consumption: The amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle (per kilometer or mile) during the delivery, often used for optimizing fuel efficiency.

Latitude_x and Longitude_x: The geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the delivery origin point, used for mapping and distance calculations.

Delivery_Location_ID_x: A unique identifier for the delivery location (origin).

Demand_x: The amount of goods (in units) required at the delivery location.

Delivery_Time_Window_x: The time period (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening) within which the delivery is expected to be made. This helps prioritize and optimize delivery schedules based on customer requirements.
